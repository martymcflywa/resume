I am writing with interest regarding the ``Java API Developer'' position advertised on \href{https://www.seek.com.au/job/33237951?type=standout&tier=no_tier&pos=1&whereid=3000&userqueryid=9ed0336a00786a41bf4398256cfb67a3-2819278&ref=beta}{Seek.com.au}. I am mature age student, in my third and final year of studying Bachelor of Computer Science at Edith Cowan University, majoring in Software Engineering and recently spent 18 months at IBM as a Software Developer Intern where I worked on real commercial products.

I have a passion for writing code and problem solving and my ultimate goal is to pursue a long lasting career in the software development industry. I've had a taste of what it's like in the industry for the last 18 months and I have met all demands and challenges head on with enthusiasm and a thirst for learning.

During my time at IBM, I was involved with two projects. The first was z Operational Insights (zOI) where myself and another intern developed additional proof of concept insights. This project involved adding new features to analyse a new subset of log records in a Java 8 based backend which then provided REST API endpoints so that the Angular 1 based frontend could request the analysis output in JSON format. I was also involved in developing new views for these outputs, using Angular 1 and D3.js to visualize the data.

The second project was Common Data Provider for z Systems (CDPz), where I spent the majority of my time at IBM. My responsibility was to develop a Java 7 based component called the Data Streamer that accepted log records from multiple gatherers over TCP/IP, process that data, then send it on to multiple subscribers, also via TCP/IP. As well as development code, all classes and methods were delivered with corresponding unit tests and I was also involved in code reviews. In addition to development, I was also involved in writing documentation for features I developed which were included in the user manual. I was given the responsibility to design some aspects of the Data Streamer, and became regarded as one of the main developers, even though I was only an intern.

Although the projects I have been involved with did not provide any experience with databases, I have scored well (96 HD) in the Systems and Database Design unit at ECU, and have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of relational database design and implementation.

While I have yet to complete my degree, I believe that my demonstrated initiative, passion for software development and willingness to learn and share knowledge makes me a worthy candidate for the position, and plan to complete my degree by studying part time if successful in securing the role.

%I am an Australian citizen, and can provide proof of citizenship at your request. I work diligently at university which is proven by my current weighted average mark of 85.38 HD. Please find a transcript attached with this document. I have previously worked as a junior business analyst at Synergy for 12 months which provided some insight into the development lifecycle. I am also fluent in English, having excellent written and spoken communication skills.

Please find my resume and current course transcript attached below. I appreciate your consideration for the role.

%Regards,\\
%Martin Ponce
