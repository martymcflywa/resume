I am writing with interest regarding the 'Software Developer' position advertised on [seek.com.au](https://www.seek.com.au/job/35235521). I am mature age student, in my third and final year of studying Bachelor of Computer Science at Edith Cowan University, majoring in Software Engineering and have two years industry experience. I initially spent 18 months at IBM as a full-time Software Developer Intern where I worked on real commercial products, developing in Java. I have also recently completed a six month contract with Cash Converters, primarily working on business intelligence reporting read models and applications to improve marketing processes in C# and .NET.

I have a passion for writing code and problem solving and my ultimate goal is to pursue a long lasting career in the software development industry. I have mainly developed backend solutions, but I would like to become a fullstack developer, comfortable with both back and frontend technologies.

During my time at IBM, I was involved with two projects. The first was z Operational Insights (zOI) where I developed additional proof of concept insights for an existing web application. This project involved adding new REST API endpoints which triggered analysis of a new subset of log records in a Java backend, providing results to an Angular 1 frontend in JSON format. I was also involved in developing new views for these outputs, using D3.js to visualize the data.

The second project at IBM was Common Data Provider for z Systems (CDPz), where I spent the majority of my time. My responsibility was to develop a Java based component called the Data Streamer that accepted log records from multiple sources, transform the data as configured by the user, then send it on to multiple consumers, serialized to the required format, such as JSON for Logstash. All code was delivered with corresponding JUnit tests and required stubs in Mockito. In addition to development, I was also involved in writing documentation for features I developed which were included in the user manual. I was given the responsibility to design some aspects of the Data Streamer, and was considered an owner of the Java code, even though I was only an intern. I was also given a fantastic opportunity to travel to the IBM campus in North Carolina, US, to provide training and hand over the project to a new development team.

I also spent six months at Cash Converters as a contractor, broadening my skills with C# and .NET. I was exposed to a formal development lifecycle, following Cash Converters best practices, performing kickoffs with testers to determine acceptance criteria for stories. I was involved in code reviews as both reviewee and reviewer, and upheld their standards with SOLID and DRY principles. I was also exposed to test and behaviour driven development, working with xUnit, BDDfy and NSubstitute testing and mock frameworks. I worked on improving test times for Business Intelligence solutions in AppVeyor, by modifying yaml and powershell scripts to avoid redundant rebuild steps. I was also responsible for improving Business Intelligence deployment resiliency on an on-premise Octopus Deploy instance, by ensuring that tool dependencies were included in the package, allowing continuous delivery even if access to the internet was not available.

The highlight of my time at Cash Converters was my involvement in the development of an event source replicator, from an SQL source to a flat file MessagePack binary format. The goal of this story was to improve Business Intelligence read model population, replacing event source reads from a remote SQL server, to reading from flat files stored directly with the read model populators on NVMe drives. This slashed complete read model rebuild times in half. While the primary consumer of these flat files were Business Intelligence services, I created packages to enable internal developers to utilize and listen to events stored in the flat file binary format for other projects. I received praise from my peers and was told they could quickly prototype new solutions, from zero code to a fully populated read model within a couple of hours.

Although I don't have major industry experience with database design, I have had experience in querying SQL (MS SQL and MySQL). The read model I developed in Cash Converters Business Intelligence team is persisted in SQL and
